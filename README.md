1. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository**:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

**Check out to the branch you want to work on

```bash
git checkout master
```

If the `master` branch does not exist, you might need to create it:

```bash
git checkout -b master
```

**Pull the latest changes from the remote repository**:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

If these steps do not resolve the issue, it might be due to corruption in your local repository. In this case, you might need to clone the repository again:

Remove the existing repository
rm -rf WebServis

Clone the repository again
git clone <https://github.com/Jolana1/WebServis.git>

Remember to replace `master` with the name of the branch you want to work on if it's not `master`. Also, replace `https://github.com/Jolana1/WebServis.git` with the URL of your actual repository.

Jolana1:
How can i replace `https://github.com/Jolana1/WebServis.git` with the URL of your actual repository.

GitHub Copilot: To replace the URL of the remote repository in Git, you can use the `git remote set-url` command. Here's how you can do it:

First, check the current remote repository URL:

```bash
git remote -v
```

This will display the URLs of your remote repositories.

To change the URL of the remote repository, use the `git remote set-url` command:

```bash
git remote set-url origin your-repository-url
```

Replace `your-repository-url` with the URL of your actual repository. For example:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
```

Verify that the URL has been changed:

```bash
git remote -v
```

This should now display the new URL for your remote repository.
